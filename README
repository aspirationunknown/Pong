Mode: Practice
Difficulty Levels: Easy, Medium, Hard

Player controls:   'w' = up
                   'a' = left
                   's' = down
                   'd' = right

In this mode the left-hand side is player controlled and the right-hand side is computer controlled.
The different difficulty levels determine how much spin the computer is able to put on the ball and
how well it is able to follow the ball. The practice match ends when either player's score reaches 10.
